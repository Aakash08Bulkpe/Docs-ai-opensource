API Introduction

The Bulkpe API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Production Base URL

https://api.bulkpe.in/

Reach out to us at 
support@bulkpe.in
 for any support.

Easy navigation

For Payouts product - refer to 
Bulkpe Payouts

For UPI Collection product - refer to 
Scale UPI

Authorization

The Bulkpe API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Bulkpe Dashboard.

You can find your token key from your Bulkpe Web Dashboard -> 
Settings
 -> API.

How to use the token

You need to pass the API Token in the headers with the key as '
Authorization
' and the value as '
Bearer
' (prefix) followed by your token.

Example:

Whitelist your IP addresses

We highly recommend you whitelist your IP addresses from the same API 
settings
 tab from your Bulkpe Web Dashboard. Bulkpe supports whitelisting multiple IP addresses.

Adding funds to Virtual Account

Whitelist

If you're adding funds for the first time in Bulkpe, you need to whitelist your existing Bank Account of your company from

Settings
 -> Whitelist -> Add Account -> Input Account Holder Name, Account Number, and IFSC - > Submit.

Bank Account Whitelist Screen

Bulkpe may take up to 4 working hours to approve your request. You may reach out to support@bulkpe.in to speed up the process. Upon approval from Bulkpe, you can proceed to add funds via IMPS, NEFT, or RTGS.

Adding Funds

Once your Bank Accounts are whitelisted, you can add funds to your Bulkpe Wallet, and start by locating your Virtual Account Number and IFSC on your dashboard.

Please note

Transferring funds using TPAPs (Phonepe/Google Pay) will fail as TPAPs use the UPI method to transfer funds. Bulkpe Virtual Accounts only supports IMPS, RTGS, and NEFT payment methods via Banking Portals (Net Banking or Direct Bank Apps).



Key things to handle

Timestamp handling

In the Bulkpe API, timestamps are managed and stored in Coordinated Universal Time (
UTC
). To convert these timestamps to Indian Standard Time (IST), you can simply add UTC + 5:30. This ensures accurate and consistent time representation for your data.



Transaction states

Understanding the states of a transaction is crucial for effective management. In the Bulkpe API, transactions can be in the following states:

For detailed information on transaction states, refer to the description provided in the API response or callback, accessible through the "message" parameter.





Bulkpe Payouts

Use Bulkpe Payouts APIs to make payouts from your Virtual Account to any Indian Bank Account or UPI VPA.

Once a payout is initiated using 
Initiate Payout API
, Bulkpe system and bank process it. You will receive a callback from the Bulkpe system (
setup callback
) with the status of the Payout. You can also call the 
Fetch Transaction Status
 API to get the payout status.

Learn how to 
add funds to your Virtual Account
 before initiating payouts. Virtual Accounts are used to hold funds and debit the Payout Amount + Bulkpe Charges.

Webhooks





Webhooks

You can configure webhook endpoints via the Bulkpe Web Dashboard to be notified about events that happen in your Bulkpe account or connected Bank accounts.

Navigate to your Bulkpe Web Dashboard -> 
Settings
 -> Webhooks to do the same.

In the Bulkpe system, we manage webhooks through three distinct types:

1. 
Debit
: This type provides callbacks for all payout scenarios, encompassing virtual accounts and sub-virtual accounts. It covers both successful and failed transactions.
2. 
Credit
: This type facilitates callbacks for all pay-ins, whether directed to your virtual account, sub-virtual account, or collected through payment gateways.
3. 
Bank Verification
: This type of webhook generates callbacks for various verification APIs, including 
penny drop
, 
reverse penny drop
, and other non-sync verification processes.

Our webhook system ensures comprehensive coverage and timely notifications across diverse transaction types. Feel free to explore and integrate these functionalities into your system seamlessly.
